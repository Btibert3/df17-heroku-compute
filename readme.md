Repository Structure
---
* This repository has 2 distinct components
    * [force](/force): The Force.com component of the application
    * [heroku](/heroku): The Heroku component of the application
* This simplification allows developers to see and use the entire application in one place. However, for Production we would recommend you instead use small, single-purpose repositories.
